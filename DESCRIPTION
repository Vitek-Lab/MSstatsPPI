Description: A set of tools for network analysis using mass 
    spectrometry-based proteomics data and network databases. The package takes 
    as input the output of MSstats differential abundance analysis and provides 
    functions to perform enrichment analysis and visualization in the 
    context of prior knowledge from past literature. Notably, this package 
    integrates with INDRA, which is a database of biological networks
    extracted from the literature using text mining techniques.
