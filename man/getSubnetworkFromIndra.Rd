\usage{
getSubnetworkFromIndra(
  input,
  protein_level_data = NULL,
  pvalueCutoff = NULL,
  statement_types = c("IncreaseAmount", "DecreaseAmount"),
  paper_count_cutoff = 1,
  evidence_count_cutoff = 1,
  correlation_cutoff = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{output of \code{\link[MSstats]{groupComparison}} function's 
comparisionResult table, which contains a list of proteins and their 
corresponding p-values, logFCs, along with additional HGNC ID and HGNC 
name columns}

\item{protein_level_data}{output of the \code{\link[MSstats]{dataProcess}} 
function's ProteinLevelData table, which contains a list of proteins and 
their corresponding abundances.  Used for annotating correlation information 
and applying correlation cutoffs.}

\item{pvalueCutoff}{p-value cutoff for filtering. Default is NULL, i.e. no
filtering}

\item{statement_types}{list of interaction types to filter on.  Equivalent to
statement type in INDRA.  Default is c("IncreaseAmount", "DecreaseAmount").}

\item{paper_count_cutoff}{number of papers to filter on. Default is 1.}

\item{evidence_count_cutoff}{number of evidence to filter on for each
paper. E.g. A paper may have 5 sentences describing the same interaction vs 1
sentence.  Default is 1.}

\item{correlation_cutoff}{if protein_level_abundance is not NULL, apply a 
cutoff for edges with correlation less than a specified cutoff.  Default is
0.3}
}
\value{
list of 2 data.frames, nodes and edges
}
\description{
Using differential abundance results from MSstats, this function retrieves
a subnetwork of protein interactions from INDRA database.
